# Line Encoding Visualizer

This project is a **Line Encoding Visualizer** that allows users to explore and understand various line encoding schemes in digital communication. The application provides visual representations of encoded signals based on user input.

## Features

- **Supported Encoding Schemes**:
  - NRZ-I (Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted)
  - NRZ-L (Non-Return-to-Zero Level)
  - Manchester Encoding
  - Differential Manchester Encoding
  - AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion) with optional B8ZS and HDB3 scrambling
- Interactive **form submission** with real-time validation.
- **Dynamic plotting** of encoding schemes using `Chart.js`.
- **Scrambling options** for AMI encoding: B8ZS and HDB3.

## Demo

1. Choose a line encoding scheme.
2. Enter a binary sequence (e.g., `101010`).
3. Submit the form to visualize the encoded signal.
